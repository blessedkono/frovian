                    <p>At Frovian, we go beyond the traditional likelihood-impact analysis made so (in)famous by COSO.  We are experienced in not only assessing your operational and credit risks, we make a point of measuring those risks with economic capital to get a true, less subjective sense of what your risks really are.and more importantly, we tie your assessments of risk into your key strategies.  By making the strategy-analytics connection, you are better able to make decisions to improve your profitability and achieve your goals and objectives.</p>


                    <h4>Risk Management Consulting</h4>
                    <p>Not all clients are strong candidates for alternative risk financing vehicles. When and if the pre-feasibility study reveals that traditional methods of insurance are the most practical and cost-effective for the client to insure and manage risk, we can provide risk management consulting and brokerage services to our clients. With licensed property and casualty brokers and experienced underwriters on staff, we provide risk management consultation to include a comprehensive analysis of the current traditional insurance program and policies in force, recommendations for enhancements and cost savings, and available markets for placement of coverage.</p>
                    <p>We also provide independent risk management consulting where we are not directly involved with the placement of coverage. In these cases, we design the insurance coverage specifications for a Request for Proposal (RFP) process, including development of underwriting data, determining the appropriate level of risk to be retained by the client in the form of self-insurance, and assistance in the completion of a strategic and effective bidding process. We will assist with the development of service agreements to define scope of performance to be received from third party insurance brokers and underwriters and negotiate the associated fee structure on behalf of the client.</p>

                    <p>We also focus on risk exposuresmand financial outcome. Before attempting to design an insurance program to fit a client’s specific needs, exposures must be fully identified, defined and the risks quantified; only then can decisions be made as to which risks/exposures will be retained, transferred or avoided. Once this step is complete, the appropriate insurance program(s) (coverages, limits, deductibles, captives, etc.) can be properly designed.</p>


                    <h4>Tailored Risk Management Consulting</h4>
                    <p>Frovian Risk Management Consulting Services are customized for each individual client. We spend considerable time getting to know your company, its affiliated entities, your specific exposures, contract risks, your appetite for risk and more.  As part of our risk management consulting process, we leave no stone unturned when seeking to understand your business and the risks you face.</p>
